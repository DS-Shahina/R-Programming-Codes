#The elements of a vector must all have the same mode, or data type. You

#or three integer elements (of mode integer), but not a vector with one integer element and two character string elements.

data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
# Data Types in R - 
# Vector, List, Matrix, Array, Factor, Data Frame
# Vector - contains elements of same class
#A vector, in programming, is a type of array that is one dimensional. 
#Vectors are a logical element in programming languages that are used for storing data.
#Vectors are similar to arrays but their actual implementation and operation differs
#Vectors are primarily used within the programming context of most programming languages
#and serve as data structure containers. Being a data structure,
#vectors are used for storing objects and collections of objects in an 
#organized structure.


#The major difference between and array and a vector is that, unlike typical arrays, 
#the container size of a vector can be easily increased and decreased to complement 
#different data storage types. Vectors have a dynamic structure and provide the ability 
#to assign container size up front and enable allocation of memory space quickly.
#Vectors can be thought of as dynamic arrays.
# there are 6 types of these atomic vectors, also known as 6 classes of vectors which are
#Logical, Numeric, Interger, Complex, Character, Raw

#list is an object consisting of an ordered collection of objects known as its

#There is no particular need for the components to be of the same mode or type, and, for
#example, a list could consist of a numeric vector, a logical value, a matrix, a complex vector, a
#character array, a function, and so on. Here is a simple example of how to make a list:
# if you want to convert list into dataframe use - as.dataframe

# we will look into built in function of R such as apply(), lapply(), sapply(),tapply()
# functions
## apply()

# apply() functions matrix or Dataframe as input and provides output as vector, list or array
# apply() function is primarly used to avoid loop constructs. 
# apply() function takes three arguments such as
#apply(X,MARGIN,FUN) 
# where in X is a matrix or Dataframe
# Margin takes values as 1 and 2 which helps to define on where to apply function
# MARGIN = 1 manipulation is performed on rows
# MARGIN = 2 manipulation is performed on columns
# MARGIN = c(1,2) manipulation is performed on both Rows and columns
# FUN = tells which function to apply, built in funtions like mean, median, sum, min,
# max, and even user defined functions can also be applied

# for example lets considers a matrix and apply column sum on it
m1 <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 6)
m1
a_m1 <- apply(m1[,c(3,4)], 2, sum) # 3rd and 4th column = sum for both

# lapply is used to perform operations on list objects and return list object of same
# length as of original set. lapply() takes input as list, dataframe, vector and provides
# as list
# arguments of lapply() function are 
# lapply(X, FUN)
#x is vector /list / dataframe
# FUN is function 

# for example if we want to convert a list of string uppercase elements to lowercase
# we use lapply() to do it at once
#tolower is inbuilt functions

# tapply() computes a measure (mean, median, min, max, etc..) or a function for
# each factor variable in a vector. It is a very useful function that lets you 
# create a subset of a vector and then apply some functions to each of the subset.
# arguments of tapply() are 
# tapply(X, INDEX, FUN) # that index should be vector type
# X = an object, dataframe or vector
# INDEX = A list containing factor
# FUN = Functions that we want to apply such as mean, median, sum

# for example we will load a dataset called as iris

# . Statistical transformations, stats for short, summarise data in many useful

# but very useful.
# . The scales map values in the data space to values in an aesthetic space,
# whether it be colour, or size, or shape. Scales draw a legend or axes, which
# provide an inverse mapping to make it possible to read the original data

# . A coordinate system, coord for short, describes how data coordinates are
# mapped to the plane of the graphic. It also provides axes and gridlines to
# make it possible to read the graph. We normally use a Cartesian coordinate
# system, but a number of others are available, including polar coordinates
# and map projections.
# . A faceting specification describes how to break up the data into subsets
# and how to display those subsets as small multiples. This is also known as
# conditioning or latticing/trellising.
